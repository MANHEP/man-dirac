THIS IS FOR MAF USERS AND NEEDS DE-MAFFING FOR SKA!


Getting started with DIRAC job submission to MAF
================================================

This README explains how to use the example files in this directory to submit
a test job to DIRAC and have it run on MAF at Manchester. For members of LHCb
this is done using the LHCb virtual organization and LHCbDIRAC; for other 
people it's done with the NorthGrid virtual organization and the GridPP DIRAC
service.

Get a grid certificates
-----------------------
(If you've already got a grid cerificate you can skip this section.)

To use DIRAC to submit jobs you need a grid certificate. Go to the
"Request New User Certificate" form here:
 https://portal.ca.grid-support.ac.uk/caportal/
and select Manchester HEP as the Registration Authority (RA). It talks
you through the processor of creating a private key and submitting the
certifiate request to the website. The PIN it asks for doesn't need to be 
a strong password and won't be used again. However the passphrase should be
a storng password and you need to remember it. Also, BE CAREFUL TO KEEP THE 
PRIVATE KEY TEXT FILE IT GENERATES FOR YOU. If it's lost, you have to start 
again. Once the request is submitted, you should contact Sabah
( sabah.salih@manchester.ac.uk ) to get your request authorized by providing
photographic ID (eg your university
ID card.)

The registration process will eventually produce a file in .p12 format saved
to your computer. This contains your private key and your public certificate
which you can use to prove your identify to DIRAC and to computers you might
run on.

Import the certificate/key to your web browser
----------------------------------------------

Even if you have a grid certificate, make sure that it's loaded into your
web browser. It depends on your web browser how to do this: on Linux and
Windows, you usually load it via the Settings/Preferences of the browser.
For macOS, you usually load it into Keychain (see the Keychain Access app
usually in the Other folder in the Launcher.) Most things now work best
with the Google Chrome browser.

To check your certificate is loaded look at this page: 
https://viab.gridpp.ac.uk
where you should see something like this in the box at the very bottom:
"You are /C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Manchester/L=HEP/CN=andrew mcnab"

VOMS
----
(If you are an LHCb member and registered in the LHCb VOMS and LHCbDIRAC
you can skip this section.)

To use GridPP DIRAC you need to be in the vo.northgrid.ac.uk virtual 
organization. You can request vo.northgrid.ac.uk VO membership from 
https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk/ That website may not be accessible from the 
UoM_WIFI network, although eduroam, the campus network, and random ISPs
seem ok. That page has a list of VOs and vo.northgrid.ac.uk is near the 
bottom.

Request membership and follow the instructions on the webpages and the
emails it sends you. Make sure you are in the manchester group as well 
as vo.northgrid.ac.uk itself. You can check by going to
https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/voms/vo.northgrid.ac.uk/user/home.action
and scrolling down to "Your groups and roles", which should have an
entry for the group "/vo.northgrid.ac.uk/manchester"
 
Convert certificate/key to PEM format
-------------------------------------

You received your grid certificate and key in the .p12 file, and loaded
it into your web browser. To use DIRAC commands on a Linux machine, you
also need to convert the certificate and key into PEM format, with these
commands (where something.p12 is your .p12 file):

  mkdir -p $HOME/.globus
  openssl pkcs12 -in something.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem
  openssl pkcs12 -in something.p12 -nocerts -out $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem
  chmod 0400 userkey.pem

When you are asked for your passphrase, again choose a strong password
(it can be same one as you used as the passphrase during the registration
process.)

DIRAC commands look for these two files in the $HOME/.globus subdirectory
with those filenames, so if you want to work from another Linux machine,
you should recreate the $HOME/.globus directory and those two files. It's
not necessary to reapply for a new certificate if you get a new notebook,
go out to CERN etc.

GridPP DIRAC for NorthGrid users
--------------------------------

This "DIRAC client installation" section of this page explains how to set up
the GridPP DIRAC commands on your account on a Linux machine:
https://www.gridpp.ac.uk/wiki/Quick_Guide_to_Dirac#Dirac_client_installation
Use vo.northgrid.ac.uk instead of your_vo_goes_here in the commands.

That page also explains how to submit a test job, but it does it as a normal
grid user without access to the locally-funded Manchester resources in MAF.
Carry on reading this README to see how to access MAF.

LHCb DIRAC for LHCb members
---------------------------

The easiest place to use DIRAC commands for LHCb members is lxplus.cern.ch .
Just log in as normal with your CERN account and most things are set up 
automatically. Make sure $HOME/.globus is set up as described in "Convert
certificate/key to PEM format" and then do these two commands:

  lb-run LHCbDIRAC/latest bash 
  lhcb-proxy-init

lhcb-proxy-init will ask for the passphrase you gave when converting your
private key from .p12 to PEM format.

Job submission
--------------
This directory contains two files which you can use to submit a test job
to DIRAC. They work for either flavour: GridPP+NorthGrid or LHCb.

The first file is maf-test.sh which is a trivial shell script which will
be run on the MAF machine your job lands on:

  #!/bin/sh
  printenv

The second file is maf-test.jdl and describes the job to DIRAC:

  JobName = "ChangeMe";
  JobGroup = "ChangeMe";
  InputSandbox = {"maf-test.sh"};
  Executable = "maf-test.sh";
  Arguments = "123";
  StdOutput = "StdOut";
  StdError = "StdErr";
  OutputSandbox = {"StdOut","StdErr"};

The InputSandbox tells DIRAC which file(s)
you want to send with the job. In this case just maf-test.sh . The
OutputSandbox line tells DIRAC which output files you want to bring back.
In this case they will be the stdout and stderr of the maf-test.sh 
script when it runs. You should change JobName and JobGroup to something
short but specific to you. You can use this to keep track of which job
is which when you are submitting lots of them!

To submit the job to DIRAC do this:

  dirac-wms-job-submit maf-test.jdl

The command will output a number which is the JobID and used to refer
to the job in the DIRAC system. You can see what the job is doing with

  dirac-wms-job-status 1234567890

(or whatever your JobID is.) It will probably start as Waiting. When it
gets to Done, it's been run on MAF and has finished. You can get the
OutputSandbox back with the command

  dirac-wms-job-output 1234567890

and it will be created as subdirectory of the current directory, using
the JobID as the directory name. It should contain a file StdOut with
a list of the environment variables from the machine the job ran on.

DIRAC portal
------------

The DIRAC portal is a website which lets you view and manage your jobs.
It's very useful once you have lots of jobs submitted. For 
GridPP+NorthGrid the portal is here:

  https://dirac.gridpp.ac.uk/DIRAC/

For LHCb it's here:

  https://lhcb-portal-dirac.cern.ch/DIRAC/

In either case, to see your jobs select Job Monitor from the menu on
the left hand side (in the Applications section.) By default the
user should be your DIRAC username. For GridPP+NorthGrid it will be
your first and last names; for LHCb, it will be your CERN account name.
You can then see a list of your jobs, showing their state of Waiting,
Running, Done etc.
