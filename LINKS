X.509 (Grid) Certificates
-------------------------

The "Request New User Certificate" form is here:
 https://portal.ca.grid-support.ac.uk/caportal/
 You will end up with an RSA private key and an X.509 user certificate, both
 in PEM format. They should be named userkey.pem and usercert.pem and put in
 $HOME/.globus/ on the Linux machine you intend to submit jobs from.

You may need to convert PKCS8 private keys from the UK e-Science CA website to
traditional format to get them to work some clients (including curl):
 openssl pkcs8 -in userkey.old.pem -out userkey.new.pem

You can create a .p12 file for importing into a web browser with:
 openssl pkcs12 -export -in usercert.pem -inkey userkey.pem -out usercertkey.p12
 On macOS, openssl silently fails if the passphrase is too short! (<= 4 chars??)

VOMS
----
To use GridPP DIRAC you need to be in vo.northgrid.ac.uk or skatelescope.eu 
(for LHCb DIRAC, membership is via your membership of LHCb.)

With your certificate and key loaded in your browser, or the macOS KeyStore
for Safari and Chrome, you can request vo.northgrid.ac.uk or skatelescope.eu 
VO membership from 
  https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk/ 
(works from eduroam; may not be accessible from UoM_WIFI?)

New members of those two VOs should be automatically added to GridPP DIRAC
within a day (overnight?)
