X.509 (Grid) Certificates
-------------------------

The "Request New User Certificate" form is here:
 https://portal.ca.grid-support.ac.uk/caportal/
 You will end up with an RSA private key and an X.509 user certificate, both
 in PEM format. They should be named userkey.pem and usercert.pem and put in
 $HOME/.globus/ on the Linux machine you intend to submit jobs from.

You can create a .p12 file for importing into a web browser with:
 openssl pkcs12 -export -in usercert.pem -inkey userkey.pem -out usercertkey.p12
 On macOS, openssl silently fails if the passphrase is too short! (<= 4 chars??)
